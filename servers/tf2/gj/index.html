				<p>(Looking for ban appeals? <a href="/servers/tf2/gj/appeal.html">Go here</a>)</p>
				<h3>Ban Evasion isn&rsquo;t allowed</h3>

				<p>This is a bannable offense. If you break this rule, you will be banned forever.</p>
				<h3>No Adult Content</h3>
				<p>Adult Content isn&rsquo;t allowed on the community. This is to keep young users from seeing things that they should not see.</p>
				<p>This is a bannable offense. If you break this rule, you will be banned forever.</p>
				<h3>No Harassing Others</h3>

				<h3>Discussing other games is okay, as long as it is in the Random Channel</h3>
				<p>This community is primarily based off of Team Fortress 2, a Multiplayer First Person Shooter developed by Valve Software. While we do not want people to post about random games in other channels, it is fine if you post about the game in the random channel. You will not get banned, posts will be moved. However, if offense is repeated, you may get a very short 1 hour ban to clear out the channels.</p>
				<p>This is not a bannable offense. Your posts will get moved to random, or get ejected. <em><strong>If you get banned for this, the ban will only last one hour. We only ban you for this long to clear out any posts that are unrelated to the community.</strong></em></p>
				<h3>If you would like to re-enact any Team Fortress 2 Meme or Promotional video, please do so in the Memes channel.</h3>
				<p>This is to keep everything nice and organized. We wouldn&rsquo;t want to have &ldquo;Heavy is Dead&rdquo; in the Gameplay Channel, now would we? However, if offense is repeated, you may get a very short 1 hour ban to clear out the channels.</p>
				<p>This is not a bannable offense. Your posts will get moved to Memes, or get ejected. <em><strong>If you get banned for this, the ban will only last one hour. We only ban you for this long to clear out any posts that are unrelated to the community.</strong></em></p>
				<h3>No Spamming</h3>
				<p>Spamming the community is where you create a bunch of posts in quick succession. Doing this is not allowed, as we want users to see other posts in the community.</p>
				<p>This is a bannable offense. If you break this rule, your first offense will get you banned for a week. Your second offense will get you banned for a month. Your third offense gets you banned forever. <em><strong>If you get banned for this, the ban will only last one hour. We only ban you for this long to clear out any posts that are unrelated to the community.</strong></em></p>
